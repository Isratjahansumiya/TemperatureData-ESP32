# Sensor Data With MicroPython

The Weather Station is one of the most significant projects for the students of TAMK. We aim to collect the most accurate weather information. TAMK has a high-end sensor system on the rooftop to capture all types of weather data like temperature, light, rain, humidity, etc. Previously, this project was implemented with C++. But our goal is to use python for low consumption with great capabilities. In IOT, python is a great choice for the backend side of development as well as the software development of devices. There are low system requirements especially for microPython than C++. This project will guide users on how the software processes sensor data from the ESP32 board to the API.

This embedded project was guided by a teacher from TAMK. Our main goal was to see how it goes if we use python instead of C++ for the new students.

## usages

Use the files for, 

Esp32 board- ESP32/sendToRpi.py

Raspberry pi- RasberryPi/recived_inRpi.py
